* https://www.kaggle.com is a great source of datasets, competitions and discussions. It is good to use for learning purposes in Datascience.
* working with SQl and noSQL databases are pretty much the same
### What is machine learning

Type of machine learning depending on the dataset:
* Supervised
    * pre-labeling the data, classification is done by the human before
    * can help in churn prediction
* Semi-supervised
    * reinforcement learning; trying to feed data to the system while the system is working
    * Feeding pacman while it's playing about the state and reward --> Die or not
* Unsupervised 
    * Do not provide information on the dataset
    * no hints to what groups do the data belongs
    * up to the data scientist to decide what the dataset should be labelled

Most popular languages in datascience:
* Python
    * Definitely suitable for NLP thanks to libraries and for production purposes
    * Most popular language in ML
* R
* C++
* Sas
* Matlab

### Introduction to python

Anaconda: has lots of packages and let's you work in different environments. Install it from the web anaconda.com

### CRISP-DM
* Standard way to work in Data Mining
* Developed in the 90s and used as of today. (website link)[http://crisp-dm.eu]
