For example, if it were instinctive not to murder...

So, only intelligent beings can be moral, even if the bahavior of other
beings mimics theirs?  And, how much emphasis do you place on intelligence?
Animals of the same species could kill each other arbitarily, but they

most animals aren't intelligent enough to think like we do?
